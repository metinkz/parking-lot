# parking-lot
Parking lot project, made in TIA Portal, which gives status update on occupancy with maximum of 20 spaces available. 

System is put in ready state by pressing the "start" button. 
Whenever there is a car in the entrance, sensor detects it and the counter goes up by 1.
If cars are leaving, sensor at the exit detects the car and the counter goes down by 1.
- Green light is lit if there are less than 8 cars in the lot,
- Yellow light is lit if the car count is between 7 and 18,
- Red blinker light is on if the amount of cars are between 17 and 21.
